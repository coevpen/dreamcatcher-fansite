# Dreamcatcher Fansite

## Description
A fansite for the kpop girl group Dreamcatcher as a practice in React. I used Tailwind for the CSS
and useState to place the member bios in the modals when their picture is clicked on. I'm still 
working on the site and will flesh out their bios as well as start their discography page. 

## Built With
* JavaScript
* React
* HTML/CSS
* Tailwind
* NodeJS

## Deployed Link

#ToDos:
- Discography page hasn't been formatted to make it look nicer.
- Japanese site links may no longer be working due to the group no longer being signed with a Japanese company
